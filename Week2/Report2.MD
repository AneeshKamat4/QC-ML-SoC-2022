In Week 2, I read the given material i.e., pages 171-197 from QCQI, the first two chapters of the Qiskit textbook, and the  "Summary of Quantum Circuits".
- I completed a few of the coding exercises in Qiskit namely preparing the Bell and extended it to the GHZ state
- I also coded a few operations that swap the states of two qubits and increments a 3-bit number represented by three qubits 
- I further implemented the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm based on Phase Kickback and read more of the same from the Qiskit textbook
- I am working on implementing Quantum teleportation currently and expect to have it ready soon.
