In Week 1, I read the recommended readings from QCQI - pages 13-36 and 61-86 which introduced 
- a "qubit" and its geometric representation in a Bloch sphere
- two qubit states like the Bell(EPR) state and emphasized the relative strength of measurement correlations over classical analogues
- representation of quantum gates as matrices
- the Z and Hadamard single qubit gates
- the controlled NOT (CNOT) quantum gate as an analogue to the classical XOR gate
- the intuition behind using reversible quantum gates to model irreversible classical gates
- the elements in a quantum circuit
- the no-cloning theorem 
- quantum teleportation as subject to some transfer of classical information thus preserving special relativity
- quantum algorithms, the Toffoli gate and its use in simulating irreversible classical logic gates and FANOUT
- quantum parallelism and the Hadamard transform
- Deutsch's algorithm and the quantum circuit implementing it
- Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm or Deutsch's problem and the quantum circuit implementing it
