In Week 3 of Quantum Computing, I learnt and implemented the following concepts, and read the given theory. I am working on drafting a complete report describing the theory I have learnt throughout this project, including any exercises I have done. I expect to have it ready by end of this month.
- Quantum Fourier Transform
- Quantum Phase Estimation
- Shor's Algorithm
- Grover's Algorithm
